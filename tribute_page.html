        <h2 id="headline">Here's a time line of Leonardo da Vinci's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1452</strong> - Born in Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [Italy].</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1472</strong> - Leonardo was accepted into the painters’ guild of Florence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1482</strong> - Leonardo moved to Milan to work in the service of the city’s duke. He had deeper reasons for leaving Florence. It may have been that the sophisticated spirit of Neoplatonism prevailing in the Florence of the Medici went against the grain of Leonardo’s experience-oriented mind and that the more strict, academic atmosphere of Milan attracted him. Highly esteemed, he was constantly kept busy as a painter and sculptor and as a designer of court festivals. He was also frequently consulted as a technical adviser in the fields of architecture, fortifications, and military matters, and he served as a hydraulic and mechanical engineer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1483-1499</strong> - First Milanese period. As a painter, Leonardo completed six works in the 17 years in Milan, including the altar painting <i>The Virgin of the Rocks</i> and the monumental wall painting <i>Last Supper</i>. During this period Leonardo worked on a grandiose sculptural project: a monumental equestrian statue in bronze to be erected in honour of Francesco Sforza, the founder of the Sforza dynasty.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1500–1508</strong> - Second Florentine period. Leonardo seems to have been concentrating more on mathematical studies than painting. Perhaps because of his omnivorous appetite for life, Leonardo left Florence in the summer of 1502 to enter the service of Cesare Borgia as “senior military architect and general engineer”. Leonardo sketched some of the city plans and topographical maps, creating early examples of aspects of modern cartography. At the court of Cesare Borgia, Leonardo also met Niccolò Machiavelli, who was temporarily stationed there as a political observer for the city of Florence. He worked on <i>Battle of Anghiari</i>; like its intended complementary painting, Michelangelo’s <i>Battle of Cascina</i>, it remained unfinished. During these same years Leonardo painted the <i>Mona Lisa</i>. It was also a time of intensive scientific study. Leonardo did dissections in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova and broadened his anatomical work into a comprehensive study of the structure and function of the human organism. He made systematic observations of the flight of birds, about which he planned a treatise. Even his hydrological studies, “on the nature and movement of water,” broadened into research on the physical properties of water, especially the laws of currents, which he compared with those pertaining to air.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1508–1513</strong> - Second Milanese period. During this second period in Milan, Leonardo created very little as a painter but he gathered pupils around him and his scientific activity flourished. Leonardo outlined a plan for an overall work that would include not only exact, detailed reproductions of the human body and its organs but would also include comparative anatomy and the whole field of physiology. Beyond that, his manuscripts are replete with mathematical, optical, mechanical, geological, and botanical studies. These investigations became increasingly driven by a central idea: the conviction that force and motion as basic mechanical functions produce all outward forms in organic and inorganic nature and give them their shape. Furthermore, he believed that these functioning forces operate in accordance with orderly, harmonious laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1513–1518</strong> - Last years. In 1513 political events - the temporary expulsion of the French from Milan—caused the now 60-year-old Leonardo to move again. At the end of the year, he went to Rome. For three years there was a time of great artistic activity, but aging master kept a low profile while he worked in his studio on mathematical studies and technical experiments or surveyed ancient monuments. A magnificently executed map of the Pontine Marshes suggests that Leonardo was at least a consultant for a reclamation project that Giuliano de’ Medici ordered in 1514. He also made sketches for a spacious residence to be built in Florence for the Medici, who had returned to power there in 1512. However, the structure was never built. At the end of 1516 he left Italy forever and came to France where he entered King's Francis I service. Leonardo did little painting while in France, spending most of his time arranging and editing his scientific studies, his treatise on painting, and a few pages of his anatomy treatise. In the so-called <i>Visions of the End of the World series</i> (c. 1517–18), which includes the drawings <i>A Deluge</i>, he depicted with overpowering imagination the primal forces that rule nature, while also perhaps betraying his growing pessimism.

          <li><strong>1519</strong> - dies at the age of 67 in Cloux [now Clos-Lucé], France. Leonardo da Vinci was buried in the palace church of Saint-Florentin.</li>

            "With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history's most creative genius"
